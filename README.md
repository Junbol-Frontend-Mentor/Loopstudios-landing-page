## My process

### ðŸ›  Built with

- Sass(SCSS) Flexbox ðŸŽ¨
- BEM (Block.Element.Modifier)ðŸ§¾
- Mobile-first workflow ðŸ“±
- GIT/GitHub ðŸ§¾ðŸŒŽ

### What I learned

- How to write gradient variables in SCSS: $gradientOne: linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(0, 0%, 100%), hsl(0, 100%, 98%));

-  Remember how to increase the size of the fas : <i class="formContainer__icon fa fa-envelope fa-2x"></i>

-  Stay away from using nextElementSibling: is not precise enough to target the right html element use querySelector instead

- Dont use the '/' or './" on html absolute paths for images, GitHub dont like it.

```



```

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying responsive SCSS specially with Grid + Flexbox and CSS animation, transitions and FX like parallax.

### Useful resources
